# Simple-Automatic-Trash-Bin
A simple automatic open and close trash bin.
Was developed during my social activities of Gadjah Mada University (Kuliah Kerja Nyata - Universitas Gadjah Mada)
The purpose of this project is to introduce and educate Arduino to the public. So can people can take advantage of Arduino.
